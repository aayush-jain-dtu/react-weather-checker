- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid city names
- **Responsive Design**: Clean interface using Material-UI components

## What I Built

This project demonstrates:
- **React Hooks**: Used `useState` for state management across components
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with separate components for search, weather display, and app container
- **API Integration**: Integrated OpenWeather API for real-time weather data
- **Material-UI Implementation**: Used MUI components (TextField, Button, Card, Typography) for modern UI
- **Dynamic Content**: Weather cards dynamically change images and icons based on weather conditions
- **Error Handling**: Implemented try-catch for API calls with user-friendly error messages
- **Responsive Design**: CSS styling for mobile-friendly interface

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with Hooks
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for UI components
- **OpenWeather API** for weather data
- **CSS3** for custom styling
- **Vite** for fast development build
